### This script will download all the mp3 files from the Duolingo Podcast website: https://podcast.duolingo.com/
- *The script will skip the already downloaded episodes and only download the latest episodes.
- https://frpodcast.libsyn.com/rss has all the French podcasts of Duolingo. So, I used this RSS Feed for French podcasts.
- I only need *French* so, I will comment out the other languages in the Python script. I added the other languages' links in the code as commented for others who may prefer to use them. Arrange accordingly to your needs.
- I hope this helps you to learn French as well by listening to these lovely podcasts by Duolingo.
- I am not affiliated with Duolingo:) I just love their podcasts and I wanted to download them to listen offline.
- By the way, improving the code, you can make it more convenient like scraping the transcripts and podcast episodes and save them locally in a more organised way.  </br>

*Example* : </br> 
_Title_: The Final Escape - The Rebel Thief, Episode 6  </br>
_for mp3 file_: https://chtbl.com/track/198DE/traffic.libsyn.com/secure/frpodcast/S8E6_-_La_derniere_evasion_The_Final_Escape.mp3  </br>
_for Transcripts_: https://podcast.duolingo.com/episode-57-the-final-escape-the-rebel-thief-episode-6  </br>
