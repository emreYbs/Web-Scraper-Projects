# Lawless French Blog RSS Feed Downloader
### A good and helpful Blog for French learners and teachers.
 *I wrote this Python script to study French and thought it can also help other learners of French.*
### This Python script will download RSS Feeds from the _Lawless French Blog_ and save the outcome as .csv, .json, .html format under a parent folder called _"French Blogs"_

The script will download and save the RSS Feeds with the current time but *_without timezone offset_*. So you can ignore the last 4 characters in the time: *+0000*
- **Example:** 2020-05-01 12:00:00 *+0000*  </br>The reason I wrote like this is to enable the user a little more privacy. So their geo location will not be revealed in the saved .csv, .json and .html files.
- Not important for many, but for a OSINT practitioner, this is important.
